Using statistical models and data from the previous decades, we investigated trends and the effects of AQI on cancer rates.

However, the data points display considerable variability, indicating that while air quality might influence cancer rates, other factors also play significant roles. Notably, the concentration of data points at lower AQI values suggests that most observations are from areas with relatively better air quality, while the sparser data at higher AQI values, accompanied by some outliers, may warrant further research to understand anomalies or regional specifics affecting this relationship.")),
